## Augmented Reality App Video Tutorial

In order to provide documentation for future students, we decided to record some videos with our experiences.

The first one is an augmented reality app which just creates a tunnel view effect, like in our prototype  [Tunnel View Test Prototype]({% post_url 2016-010-05-tunnel_view_test%}).

In order to achieve this, you will need to install or download:

- [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) 
- [Android SDK & Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
- [Vuforia 6](https://developer.vuforia.com/downloads/sdk)

You also need to log into [Vuforia Developer](https://developer.vuforia.com/) for downloading Vuforia 6 and get the necessary key to use the Vuforia AR Camera in your app. 

Note: the video quality is much better if you watch it direct in [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynpqrB3sgWc)
