## *Tunnel View Test*

One of our goals for this week was to build a prototype for Google Cardboard simulating the tunnel view effect. As its name indicates, in this view you only can have a clear view of the environment situated at the center. The peripheral vision is affected and becomes blurred. After several hours working with Unity and Vuforia we can show you:

Of course this is only a prototype without any functionality or 3d effect. But it works!
Next steps are:

-  How can we configure "how much blurred" is the view?
-  How can we change from this "blured view" to another view?
-  How can we integrate this view in a 3D environment?

As usual in this work, there are more questions than answers.
