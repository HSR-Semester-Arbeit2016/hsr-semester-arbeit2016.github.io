## Simulating substance-influence in an AR/VR Cardboard-App, Project Kickoff

Today we had the project kickoff of our student research project.
In this meeting  Prof. Augenstein explained us the school requirements for the student research project and the necessary infrastructure (Repositories, Documentation, etc.) and described with detail the project idea.

## Idea

The idea is to build an Augmented Realty application for android phones simulating the visual alcohol effects.
The non-profit organisation [Fachstelle Am Steuer Nie (ASN)](https://www.fachstelle-asn.ch/de/home) pursues the reduction of the traffic accidents caused by alcohol consumption. In its educational projects ASN wants to introduce a modern technology like Augmented Reality in order to be more attractive for young people.

Our task is to research the available technology offers and how could it be possible to apply them to the project. At the same time, we have to try to build a prototype if possible.
