## *Project Kickoff*
---

One of our goals in this project is to simulate the effects of alcohol in the vision. In order to achieve that, the research lead us to the [Image Effects reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/comp-ImageEffects.html) from Unity. 

These effects handle all the render-based image postprocessing effects, which allow us to simulate physical camera properties like Blur and Noise effects. 

From the Unity documentation we can show this example:

Scene with no Image Effects

Blur Effect and Noise Effect applied to the same camera:

Or, applied to our Tunnel View Test prototype:
